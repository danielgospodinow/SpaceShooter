### A two-player mobile game

##

###### Brief description:
- **Spaceshooter** represents a multiplayer game for mobile devices. 
- It's played via a Local Area Connection (e.g being connected to the same Wi-Fi network) by two people. 
- Every player has his own ship and field, also each player's playground field is contained in his own device's screen. 
- **The main idea of the game is that the two players have to join their phones together so they can form the whole playground.** 
- Every player has the option to create or to join a certain server on the network, so basically two players can connect and play with each other by creating and connecting to a server (the first one has to create a server and the second one has to connect to him). 
- Gameplay mechanics are based on device shaking (for movement) and screen touching (for shooting). 
- Each player's ship has 6 lives. 
- Players can long press the screen to stack up a big missile or just shoot a little missile which does 1 damage, whereas the stacked missile does damage based on the level of stacking - this is a good way to one-shot an opponent. 
- The little rectangles around each ship indicate current lives left, also they indicate the max stacking level for the big missile. 
- Upon dying, the game restarts for another round.
